🌌 Overview

QUENNE-Space-OS is a research-grade operating system architecture for autonomous, intelligent space infrastructure.

It extends the QUENNE-ENERGOS and QUENNE-AI-OS foundations into the space domain, providing a unified experimental platform for:
   •   Autonomous satellite constellations
   •   AI-assisted space habitats
   •   Deep-space mission autonomy
   •   Orbital traffic management
   •   Human-AI collaboration in extreme environments

This platform is designed for simulation, experimentation, and pre-mission validation of next-generation space systems.

🧠 What makes QUENNE-Space-OS different

Unlike traditional spacecraft flight software, QUENNE-Space-OS explores how intelligence itself should be organized in space:
Traditional Space Software
QUENNE-Space-OS
Rule-based control
Learning-based autonomy
Ground-dependent
Edge-native decision making
Static mission plans
Adaptive mission evolution
Isolated spacecraft
Swarm & collective intelligence
Hard-coded safety
Cognitive + ethical safety layers
